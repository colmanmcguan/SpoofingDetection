GRFICS Spoofing Attacks

+=======================================+
|           Points of Attack            |
+=======================================+

Within the chemical plant simulation, there are 9 sensors and 4
actuators. When implementing attacks, all of the actuators and 7
of the sensors are manipulated. This is because 2 of the sensors
are not used in process control. All attacks are performed using
a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack -- i.e., the modbus packets
between communicating components are intercepted and 
manipulated.

Sensors
  + Feed 1:
    - Feed 1 contains a sensor which indicates the current
      flow from Feed 1 into the reaction tank.
  + Feed 2:
    - Feed 2 contains a sensor which indicates the current
      flow from Feed 2 into the reaction tank.
  + Purge:
    - Purge contains a sensor which indicates the current
      outflow from the reaction tank into the Purge.
  + Product:
    - Product contains a sensor which indicates the current
      outflow from the reaction tank into the Product.
  + Tank:
    - The tank contains two sensors; one indicates the current
      pressure in the tank and the other indicates the liquid
      level.
  + Composition:
    - The Composition contains 3 sensors; each one indicates
      the percentage of each chemical which has been purged.
      Only the sensor for A in purge is of interest as it is
      the only one used in process control.
  + Each sensor is of different units, but the raw values are
    from 0-65535.

Actuators
  + Feed 1:
    - The Feed 1 actuator is a valve controlling the main
      chemical input stream into the plant.
  + Feed 2:
    - The Feed 2 actuator is a valve controlling a second
      input stream into the plant.
  + Purge:
    - The Purge actuator is a valve used to relieve excess
      pressure from the reaction.
  + Product:
    - The Product actuator is a valve is used to extract the
      product from the reaction
  + For all valves, there is a single value which can be
    manipulated -- the valve position.
  + The valve position is a continuous value 0-65535 where 0
    closed and 65535 is all the way open.

|            Types of Attack            |
+=======================================+

Single-Sensor Attacks
=====================

The value of a single sensor reading from any point in the
chemical process is intercepted and manipulated. For example,
the Tank sends to the PLC that the pressure reading is 55000;
the modbus packet is intercepted and the value of the reading
changed to 0.

Multi-Sensor Attacks
====================

The value of multiple sensor readings from any point in the
chemical process are intercepted and manipulated. For example,
the Tank sends to the PLC that the pressure reading is 55000;
the modbus packet is intercepted and the value of the reading
changed to 0. Additionally, Feed 1 sends to the PLC that the
current flow rate is 0; the modbus packet is intercepted and
the value of the reading is changed to 65535.

Single Actuator Attacks
=======================

The value the PLC sends to the actuator is intercepted and
manipulated at a single point within the system. For example,
the position of a valve is manipulated. Note that only Feed 1,
Feed 2, Purge, and Product contain actuators.

Multi-Actuator Attacks
======================

The value of two or more actuators are intercepted and
manipulated. For example, the actuator values of both Feed 1 and
Feed 2 are written to 0, closing both of them.

Complex Attacks
===============

Any combination of both sensors and actuators are manipulated.
For example, flow and pressure readings are manipulated, the
actuator value of Purge is manipulated, and the actuator and
flow reading of Feed 1 are manipulated.

+=======================================+
|        Multi-Actuator Attacks         |
+=======================================+

There are several combination of actuator attacks that can be
performed given the 4 valves. Rather than exhausting that list,
only 6 are implemented. The goal of these attacks is to
manipulate two or more actuators simultaneously. They are as
follows:

  + Attack 46:
    - Manipulate Feed 1 actuator to 0.
    - Manipulate Feed 2 actuator to 0.
  + Attack 47:
    - Manipulate Feed 1 actuator to 65535.
    - Manipulate Feed 2 actuator to 65535.
  + Attack 48:
    - Manipulate Purge actuator to 0.
    - Manipulate Product actuator to 0.

+=======================================+
|            Complex Attacks            |
+=======================================+

Complex attacks have the potential to do the most damage to the
plant due to the wide range of control that can be gained over
the processes. There are again multiple combinations of attacks
for this category, but only two are implemented.

  + Attack 52:
    - Manipulate sensor readings coming from the Tank and
      Composition to reflect normal operation.
    - Manipulate Feed 1 actuator to 65535.
    - Manipulate Feed 2 actuator to 65535.
    - Manipulate Purge actuator to 0.
    - Manipulate Product Actuator to 0.
  + Attack 53:
    - Manipulate Tank pressure reading to 65535.
    - Manipulate Tank liquid level to 0.
